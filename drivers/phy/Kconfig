config GENERIC_PHY
	tristate "PHY Core"
	help
	  Generic PHY support.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for PHY
	  devices present in the kernel. This layer will have the generic
	  API by which phy drivers can create PHY using the phy framework and
	  phy users can obtain reference to the PHY. All the users of this
	  framework should select this config.

config PHY_EXYNOS_MIPI_VIDEO
	tristate "S5P/EXYNOS SoC series MIPI CSI-2/DSI PHY driver"
	help
	  Support for MIPI CSI-2 and MIPI DSI DPHY found on Samsung S5P
	  and EXYNOS SoCs.

config OMAP_USB2
	tristate "OMAP USB2 PHY Driver"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	depends on USB_PHY
	select GENERIC_PHY
	select OMAP_CONTROL_USB
	help
	  Enable this to support the transceiver that is part of SOC. This
	  driver takes care of all the PHY functionality apart from comparator.
	  The USB OTG controller communicates with the comparator using this
	  driver.

config TWL4030_USB
	tristate "TWL4030 USB Transceiver Driver"
	depends on TWL4030_CORE && REGULATOR_TWL4030 && USB_MUSB_OMAP2PLUS
	depends on USB_PHY
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the USB OTG transceiver on TWL4030
	  family chips (including the TWL5030 and TPS659x0 devices).
	  This transceiver supports high and full speed devices plus,
	  in host mode, low speed.

config PHY_EXYNOS_DP_VIDEO
	tristate "EXYNOS SoC series Display Port PHY driver"
	depends on OF
	select GENERIC_PHY
	help
	  Support for Display Port PHY found on Samsung EXYNOS SoCs.

config PHY_SAMSUNG_USB2
	tristate "Samsung USB 2.0 PHY driver"
	select GENERIC_PHY
	select MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Enable this to support the Samsung USB 2.0 PHY driver for Samsung
	  SoCs. This driver provides the interface for USB 2.0 PHY. Support for
	  particular SoCs has to be enabled in addition to this driver. Number
	  and type of supported phys depends on the SoC.

config PHY_S5PV210_USB2
	bool "Support for S5PV210"
	depends on PHY_SAMSUNG_USB2
	depends on ARCH_S5PV210
	help
	  Enable USB PHY support for S5PV210. This option requires that Samsung
	  USB 2.0 PHY driver is enabled and means that support for this
	  particular SoC is compiled in the driver. In case of S5PV210 two phys
	  are available - device and host.

config PHY_EXYNOS4210_USB2
	bool "Support for Exynos 4210"
	depends on PHY_SAMSUNG_USB2
	depends on CPU_EXYNOS4210
	help
	  Enable USB PHY support for Exynos 4210. This option requires that
	  Samsung USB 2.0 PHY driver is enabled and means that support for this
	  particular SoC is compiled in the driver. In case of Exynos 4210 four
	  phys are available - device, host, HSCI0 and HSCI1.

config PHY_EXYNOS4212_USB2
	bool "Support for Exynos 4212"
	depends on PHY_SAMSUNG_USB2
	depends on (SOC_EXYNOS4212 || SOC_EXYNOS4412)
	help
	  Enable USB PHY support for Exynos 4212. This option requires that
	  Samsung USB 2.0 PHY driver is enabled and means that support for this
	  particular SoC is compiled in the driver. In case of Exynos 4212 four
	  phys are available - device, host, HSIC0 and HSIC1.
