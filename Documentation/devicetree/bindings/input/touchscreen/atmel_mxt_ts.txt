* Atmel maXtouch touchscreen controller

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "atmel,maxtouch"
- reg: I2C address of the chip
- interrupt-parent: interrupt controller which provides the interrupt
- interrupts: interrupt signal to which the chip is connected
- atmel,x-line: horizonal line
- atmel,y-line: vertical line
- atmel,x-size: horizontal resolution of touchscreen
- atmel,y-size: vertical resolution of touchscreen
- atmel,burst-length: burst length
- atmel,threshold: threshold
- atmel,orientation: touchscreen orientation, must be one of following:
    - 0: normal
    - 1: diagonal
    - 2: horizonally flipped
    - 3: rotated by 90 degrees counter-clockwise
    - 4: vertically flipped
    - 5: rotated by 90 degress clockwise
    - 6: rotated by 180 degrees
    - 7: diagonal counter

Optional properties:
- vdd-supply: voltage regulator used for power control and reading
  operating voltage

Example:

	i2c@00000000 {
		/* ... */

		tsp@4a {
			compatible = "atmel,maxtouch";
			reg = <0x4a>;
			interrupt-parent = <&gpe1>;
			interrupts = <7 2>;

			atmel,x-line = <19>;
			atmel,y-line = <11>;
			atmel,x-size = <800>;
			atmel,y-size = <480>;
			atmel,burst-length = <0x11>;
			atmel,threshold = <0x28>;
			atmel,orientation = <1>;

			vdd-supply = <&tsp_reg>;
		};

		/* ... */
	};
